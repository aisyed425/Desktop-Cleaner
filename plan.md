(set to be deleted)

Planning out how to create this.

Tech Stack for this project:

Frontend: React or plain HTML/CSS

Backend: Node.js filesystem (fs), chokidar for watch, node-fetch if needed.

Packaging: electron-builder (creates Windows .exe, macOS .dmg, Linux .AppImage)

Setting Milestones:

Part 1 
- Create Electron + React scaffold
- Make the app open a window

Part 2 
- Implement scanner util
- Add categorization

## Final tips

- Use a temp directory for tests so you don’t accidentally delete real files.
- Keep commits small and descriptive; open issues for each feature.
- Add a “How to contribute” section in README and a Code of Conduct if public.
